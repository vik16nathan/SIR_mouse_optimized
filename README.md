# SIR_mouse_optimized
Code for simulating the amount of alpha synuclein accumulation/brain atrophy originating from an "epicentre."  The model optimizes parameters to simulate the spreading of endogenous aSyn (coded by the Snca gene) across the structural connectome into mesoscale brain regions, predicting output maps of alpha synuclein aggregation or brain atrophy
