# SIR_mouse_optimized
Code for simulating the amount of alpha synuclein accumulation/brain atrophy originating from an "epicentre."  The model optimizes parameters to simulate the spreading of endogenous aSyn (coded by the Snca gene) across the structural connectome into mesoscale brain regions, predicting output maps of alpha synuclein aggregation or brain atrophy. 

Code is built upon previous work from Shady Rahayel (https://github.com/srahayel/SIR_mouse ), but modified to include the non-uniform clearance of aSyn from each brain region (defined by gene expression), to optimize parameters that best fit our output pathology maps, and to distinguish between aSyn accumulation and downstream atrophy (based on the methods from Zheng et al., 2019).
